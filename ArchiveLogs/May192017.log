[18:24] <someblueguyinchat> WHAT IS THAT ABOMINATION WutFace
[18:24] <retro_specter_parker> @TheHylianGuard One of mike's emotes: SquandDog, used when you squander something. It's the dog from the botched Earthbound 64, which would later become mother 3
[18:24] <tene21> that's Limes?
[18:24] <lunarnightmoongaming> whenever me and my friends talk about mayrocrat
[18:24] <lunarnightmoongaming> we call it
[18:24] <1defix> Limes?
[18:24] <tene21> literally, "Limes?"
[18:24] <lunarnightmoongaming> "Friendship DEESTROYER"
[18:24] <tene21> IT'S CALLED A ROAD
[18:24] <1defix> No

[18:25] <a_plastic_spork> oh boi
[18:25] <doormatt232> We will never escape this damn track limesPup
[18:25] <someblueguyinchat> Limes is ded
[18:25] <gurdesthurr> I thought Mario Party was the friendship destroyer
[18:25] <retro_specter_parker> Mario Party needs wireless capabilities
[18:25] <retro_specter_parker> i m a g i n e
[18:25] <sun_glasses_guy> do some Puypuyo Tetris
[18:25] <someblueguyinchat> Aren't puzzle games streamer poison?
[18:25] <snausage_chasm> they're chat poison
[18:25] <foxesque> or get fucked out of endgame with bugs coughpreycough
[18:25] <gurdesthurr> yeah, you could piss people off all over the world
[18:25] <alchemyfun> (ditto) Citto (ditto)
[18:25] <a_plastic_spork> ba ba baaa
[18:26] <snowpixiez> @SomeBlueGuyInChat so then zelda is stream poison i guess
[18:26] <taykitty> i remember back when vinny played mk7...i fucked him up real bad and got first place
[18:26] <taykitty> i just kept a smug face on the rest of the race
[18:26] <retro_specter_parker> B-but Zelda is mostly Action RPG
[18:26] <sequenceofnumbers> Squid2 limesThump Squid2 Rainbow Road
[18:26] <taykitty> i'd never do that to limes tho, she's too cute BibleThump
[18:26] <gurdesthurr> I wouldn't consider Zelda an RPG
[18:26] <evan__m> oh my god
[18:26] <theluigiguy> LUL
[18:26] <alchemyfun> LUL
[18:26] <evan__m> get mario kart'd LUL

[18:26] <snowpixiez> @Gurdesthurr i agree with you on that
[18:27] <isghj> CurseLit
[18:27] <twospookedfourme> we lost

[18:27] <cpt_barricade> hey aisha
[18:27] <a_plastic_spork> * is a good number. It looks like a ballsack
[18:27] <cpt_barricade> are you havin fun
[18:27] <someblueguyinchat> I remember someone made art of their first place win and Vinny basically said "fuck you"
[18:27] <skinny_mario> A Bob-omb blew up my Triple Red Shells? That may one of the worst things to happen to me ever in this game.
[18:27] <pasdeseul> Good work team
[18:27] <creamgravygaming> WOO RED TEAM
[18:27] <echoech> wow red team rekt
[18:27] <foxesque> ohh team version
[18:27] <skinny_mario> At least I barely beat Aisha in this race.
[18:27] <taykitty> limesPew limesPew limesPew
[18:27] <retro_specter_parker> @Gurdesthurr You're assuming the role of Link, saving the princess and beating Ganon. Yes, there are puzzles, but it's outweighed a lot by stabbing things and boss
[18:27] <dawnyan> make the pain and misery stop limesThump
[18:27] <twospookedfourme> 200 cc
[18:27] <retro_specter_parker> It sounds like an RPG
[18:27] <1defix> The Lightning only affects the other Team
[18:27] <cpt_barricade> pain and misery is what chat feeds off of :)
[18:28] <dawnyan> freddFeels
[18:28] <skinny_mario> @someblueguyinchat Vinny asks for it, to be fair.
[18:28] <alexreznov> Sealty Aisha is funny aisha
[18:28] <doormatt232> direFeels
[18:28] <gurdesthurr> see the thing is, technically every game with a playable character would be an RPG
[18:28] <retro_specter_parker> Yep!
[18:28] <a_plastic_spork> It's what the internet as a whole feeds off of
[18:28] <taykitty> but why do they get crowns
[18:28] <mad_dawg_o> hey limes, hey chat HeyGuys
[18:28] <dangerbone> Mario Kart and Mario Party are compressed salt
[18:28] <cpt_barricade> hey mad dawg
[18:28] <gurdesthurr> I consider it more of a make your on character thing
[18:28] <airbornearcher> the amount of salt im making could fuel chip shops for years right now
[18:28] <gurdesthurr> *own
[18:28] <tene21> if skyrim's an rpg, then so is breath of the wild. that's all there is to it.
[18:28] <retro_specter_parker> But I think it applies most when the story is driven by the character
[18:28] <snausage_chasm> Zelda is obviously a dating sim
[18:28] <skinny_mario> @dangerbone The Gamecube was called Dolphin because it got four Mario Party games.
[18:28] <rawketlawnchair0> @Tene21 🤔
[18:28] <retro_specter_parker> Like... protagonist, antagonist kinda stuff
[18:29] <skinny_mario> @dangerbone Also, Bowser Shells.
[18:29] <taykitty> this course DansGame
[18:29] <someblueguyinchat> Wasn't there an RPG where you had to choose which princess to save?
[18:29] <gurdesthurr> BOTW is more RPG than the other Zelda games, yeah
[18:29] <snowpixiez> what is a bowser shell?
[18:29] <doormatt232> I mean, like every game has a protagonist/Antagonist limesPup
[18:29] <gurdesthurr> NO
[18:29] <dawnyan> Sidon direLewd
[18:29] <gurdesthurr> NO SIDON
[18:29] <zephyreth> skyrim has way more things that make it an RPG than breath of the wild
[18:29] <chi369> @Cpt_Barricade I'm uninformed, has Aisha ever played Hatoful Boyfriend
[18:29] <a_plastic_spork> I want Sidon
[18:29] <snausage_chasm> hobbNan

[18:32] <dawnyan> Kizuna
[18:32] <chi369> @Limealicious play danganronpa series, it'll take you multiple streams and will provide much husbando romancing
[18:32] <a_plastic_spork> If they isn't husbando romancing, no reason to play
[18:32] <chi369> I have a hidden agenda to get as many streamers to play danganronpa as possible
[18:32] <dangerbone> @Limealicious Rune Factory 4 is pretty good for romancing husbandos
[18:32] <rawketlawnchair0> I like that Limes? character
[18:32] <mario1080p> you leaving us will make us lose points @AirborneArcher
[18:33] <doormatt232> I still need to play Danganraonpa. Its sitting in my steam library limesHmm

[18:33] <dawnyan> one is a grapefruit
[18:33] <a_plastic_spork> Mario Kart needs husbando romancing
[18:33] <snausage_chasm> whoever said that is a liar
[18:33] <chi369> someone hasn't played school/island mode
[18:33] <someblueguyinchat> It was weird seeing a game advertised on a sketchy website and then seeing it on Steam the next day

[19:25] <rosewoes> what is 200cc exactly? i know nothing about mario kart im sorry
[19:25] <propfortytwo> unhelpful prop is unhelpful \ PogChamp / i've fulfilled my purpose
[19:25] <dawnyan> it's a racing speed, the fastest one
[19:25] <a_plastic_spork> 200cc means you go faster
[19:25] <skinny_mario> @rosewoes It's absurdly fast.
[19:25] <lunarnightmoongaming> @RoseWoes take 150, make it faster, unmanagable, almost impossible to turn,
[19:25] <tioxyco> 200cc is super sonic racing
[19:25] <tioxyco> Gotta go fast
[19:25] <bobstick5> in 200 cc, you actually have to break around corners
[19:26] <dawnyan> we're in australia now limesPup
[19:26] <rosewoes> sounds horrible :o
[19:26] <vandooznl> Mr dink
[19:26] <skinny_mario> @rosewoes 50cc is 0.85, 100cc is 1.00, 150cc is 1.15, and 200cc is 1.45. That's an estimate, at least.
[19:26] <doormatt232> why limesPup why rainbow road limesPup
[19:26] <cptdumplin> End them.
[19:26] <bobstick5> i found, that if you press the break and gas at the same time, its easy.

[19:30] <fred> let's pick on the streamer xD
[19:30] <dawnyan> Are we raiding tomorrow, seems like some of the core members can't make it if I read it right? limesHmm
[19:30] <lunarnightmoongaming> online mario cart is just ass cause you'll always get fooped one way or the other
[19:30] <chromatic_aberrations> He gets TERRIBLE RNG when he plays online. The last time he played online he got almost 3 mushrooms.
[19:30] <stickguymb> He's really good, but when stuff starts happening, he can't get himself together
[19:30] <skinny_mario> @fred You are never Freddy for the item onslaught.
[19:30] <stickguymb> Also, streamer targeting a little
[19:30] <skinny_mario> @chromatic_aberrations Hey, Chromatic.
[19:31] <dawnyan> how did these chomps get here
[19:31] <a_plastic_spork> Last time vinny played he got like 24 mushrooms in a row. I shit you not
[19:31] <ajajajaj5> limesHmm
[19:31] <dawnyan> why do they perptually bounce
[19:31] <icecramecone> I'll miss you again, uncle
[19:31] <chromatic_aberrations> @skinny_mario HeyGuys
[19:31] <doormatt232> To be fair, in a racing game its real easy to focus entirely on getting ahead, and when something breaks that focus it can be hard to recover it. Mario Kart is FILLED with focus breaking items
[19:31] <propfortytwo> is this a different rainbow road or something
[19:31] <rosewoes> at least there are bumpers on this rainbow road
[19:31] <dawnyan> I think taking a week out is a good idea limesPup if other people agree to it
[19:31] <skinny_mario> @dawnyan Super Mario Galaxy 2 reveals that they are manufactured in space.
[19:31] <chromatic_aberrations> @PropFortyTwo I believe there are 3 different Rainbow Roads on Deluxe.
[19:31] <ecrelia> well, shit.. I was gaining on second and my switch went to sleep. rip
[19:31] <awoodct> I'd never want to be a steamer and play this because it's so easy to snipe streamers. If there were an option in tournaments to disable the name tags until the end of the race that would be dope
[19:32] <doormatt232> I'm cool with taking a week out uwu I might still log on and do dailies during raid time, I find it relaxing
[19:32] <skinny_mario> @chromatic_aberrations Yes, SNES, 64, and the new one.
[19:32] <mario1080p> personally, I feel Vinny should tackle the 150cc Staff Ghosts. They offer a decent challenge and he can unlock the Golden Wheels that way.
[19:32] <orangewill> MY PICK TWICE IN A ROW PogChamp
[19:32] <skinny_mario> @mario1080p That might make for an interesting stream. It would also show how he plays offline.

[19:33] <rsdj007> They have high speed and low acceleration I think.
[19:33] <rosewoes> june 13-15

[20:09] <robotbird2000> hey, chat!
[20:09] <cptdumplin> @samiam1616 to be fair, it is a good game
[20:09] <samiam1616> As did The Culling, DayZ, Dead By Daylight, etc
[20:09] <angeluslapsis> @samiam1616 PUBG is pretty decent
[20:09] <hysteria5u> Lime playing this type of game? What kind of dream reality do I live in?
[20:09] <angeluslapsis> people still play Dead by Daylight actually
[20:09] <someblueguyinchat> H1Z1, DayZ, now this
[20:09] <samiam1616> Oh I know it's a good/decent enough game, it's just weird seeing so many different people doing it
[20:09] <sir_buttox> hey limes, have you read Ava's Demon yet?
[20:09] <angeluslapsis> was auto hosting some people earlier that were lol
[20:09] <mrrussellthestone> DayZ was more about the survival I guess
[20:10] <robotbird2000> ^
[20:10] <cptdumplin> games bring people together
[20:10] <samiam1616> Okay well at least The Culling
[20:10] <doormatt232> Oddly enough, this game seems to be pretty quality. I kinda hope it isn't just flavor of the month
[20:10] <ajajajaj5> i thought dead by daylight was the hide and seek game
[20:10] <dawnyan> For Honour ended up being FotM I think limesPup
[20:10] <edurpack> do all the things
[20:10] <doormatt232> For Honor had a few issues from what I remember
[20:10] <angeluslapsis> @cptdumplin remember like 10 - 15 years ago when playing video games was frowned on by the general public?
[20:10] <someblueguyinchat> I think it's so popular because it's like a third person shooter, a survival game, and a MOBA had a threesome baby
[20:10] <samiam1616> PUBG was last month's flavor too, so at the very least it has some longevity
[20:11] <cptdumplin> and now, I met some of my best friends through games
[20:11] <samiam1616> Hopefully it doesn't get squandered
[20:11] <angeluslapsis> now there are E Sports and massive conventions just for games and gaming tourny's?

[20:11] <ysenhal> Limes not first to die! Good job.
[20:12] <retro_specter_parker> @Limealicious You killed Revali!
[20:12] <angeluslapsis> the rookie just saved 1 out of 3 teammates
[20:12] <angeluslapsis> its a win!

[20:12] <watch_er> sights
[20:12] <gurdesthurr> good, Revali should be dead
[20:12] <someblueguyinchat> Thanks for nothing, Fox!
[20:12] <hysteria5u> you rekt that dude, savage :)
[20:12] <mrrussellthestone> How does limes get out of this chicken shit outfit
[20:12] <samiam1616> Don't worry, as long as you stay out of major lines of sight, you should be fine
[20:12] <theluigiguy> pub GUH
[20:12] <mrrussellthestone> Wow top 30 for seal PogChamp
[20:12] <angeluslapsis> @Sir_Buttox you gotta keep in mind, almost any game that involves female characters will try to force ta sex appeal aspect to it.
[20:12] <gurdesthurr> also what's wrong with exaggerating booty?
[20:13] <dawnyan> LUL
[20:13] <watch_er> PUBG
[20:13] <robotbird2000> DuckerZ
[20:13] <sir_buttox> limes, you have an evil laugh
[20:13] <samiam1616> How much is this game anyway?
[20:13] <dessart> Murder Island!
[20:13] <samiam1616> I never bothered to look that up surprisingly
[20:13] <mrrussellthestone> Top 25
[20:13] <doormatt232> 29.99 I believe?
[20:13] <someblueguyinchat> $30
[20:13] <angeluslapsis> ^
[20:13] <doormatt232> USD that is
[20:13] <retro_specter_parker> Use it to set up AMBUSH
[20:13] <angeluslapsis> it was on sale other day
[20:13] <angeluslapsis> dunno if still is
[20:13] <samiam1616> If it's not a roguellike, it's a soulslike
[20:13] <cptdumplin> Dead Cells is fuckin awesome tho
[20:13] <samiam1616> And if it's neither, it's an Earthboundlike
[20:13] <theluigiguy> The Dark Souls of Dark Souls
[20:13] <dawnyan> roguelike soulslike metroidvanialike
[20:14] <samiam1616> All of them are randomly generated
[20:14] <cptdumplin> I bought it yesterday and could NOT stop playing
[20:14] <samiam1616> And Early Access
[20:14] <robotbird2000> LUL
[20:14] <sir_buttox> @AngelusLapsis yeah, they always do that to the playermodels. to be honest, i'm getting sick of it
[20:14] <mad_dawg_o> OMG limes is playing this game ohhhhhh
[20:14] <theluigiguy> limesFert
[20:14] <mrrussellthestone> That nervous 'I'm ok'
[20:14] <samiam1616> Ferret's gonna throw you off your game
[20:14] <dawnyan> limesFert
[20:14] <mrrussellthestone> Yeah she totally has ammo
[20:14] <cptdumplin> It's unarguably one of the best, most polished Early Access games I ever played
[20:14] <doormatt232> 2/4 of the team is dead, tag sky in limesChamp
[20:14] <cptdumplin> and I played a kit
[20:14] <watch_er> limesFert 🔫
[20:14] <cptdumplin> lot*
[20:14] <someblueguyinchat> Like I said before, thanks to Early Access, "alpha" now means what "beta" used to mean
[20:15] <redvc> Ded in 1 min
[20:15] <dessart> It's crazy how this game blew up.
[20:15] <samiam1616> You'll be in the top 5 players, standing prone waiting for any sign of movement when Sky flails a little for cute reasons causing you to panicfire
[20:15] <gurdesthurr> I'd rather the character has exaggerated booty than no booty at all
[20:15] <watch_er> limesChamp 🔫 limesHi
[20:15] <dawnyan> 🔫 limesHi
[20:15] <mrrussellthestone> Throw it wrong
[20:15] <angeluslapsis> did I miss anything? my browser page for twitch crashed. Just the twitch page. no other pages crashed. what even @_@
[20:16] <mrrussellthestone> Careful seal, windows are the enemy
[20:16] <hysteria5u> @Gurdesthurr I agree, the booty should be the main focus of character creation in vidya games
[20:16] <samiam1616> There's a little thing above the map which shows how far you are to the safe zone I think
[20:16] <thehylianguard> Hey again Limes! Is it just me or does Mario Kart look different?
[20:16] <doormatt232> Oddly enough, I had a similar game breaking bug in Dishonored 2 limesHmm missing important character kept me from beating the game

[20:18] <cptdumplin> @hisamekuraiden with slugs, in Battlefield you can actually snipe people with a shotgun across 100s of yards
[20:19] <psychowithanrpg> "Why are Melee weapons a thing" Have you heard of our lord and savior Frying Pan?
[20:19] <hisamekuraiden> @cptdumplin So it IS a Metal Gear.
[20:19] <robotbird2000> we'll be on bae Kappa
[20:19] <cptdumplin> @PsychowithanRPG How dare you mispronounce the name of the glorious buttpan
[20:19] <mrrussellthestone> Careful seal or you will die
[20:19] <sir_buttox> @Limealicious just how rediculous can you be?
[20:19] <angeluslapsis> @PsychowithanRPG our lord and savior Frying Pan is not a weapon! It perpetually saves a portion of our back from projectiles!

[20:21] <angeluslapsis> to be fair, if you do a superman punch it usually auto down's people in 1 hit. think it is the jump punch combo that makes it hit the head hit box

[20:22] <samiam1616> You know, now that I think about it, how did "PUBG" catch on as the proper acronym when "PUB" would seemingly work equally as well, if not better?
