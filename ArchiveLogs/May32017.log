[16:47] <rsdj007> Suvi tho Kreygasm

[16:47] <xifihas> I went with Tali. She was adorable, smart and kicked ass.

[16:51] <someblueguyinchat> How far is Limes into the game?
[16:51] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> 50 Percent.
[16:51] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Not including Side-Quests.
[16:51] <someblueguyinchat> Oh, ok

[16:52] <serrai> she hit that guy so hard he back in the milky way galaxy
[16:52] <djeeza1> this dude dont need a ship for going back
[16:52] <someblueguyinchat> [inser Goofy yell]
[16:52] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> The best way to get a good character is to spec into all trees to unlock the Jack-of-all-trades.
[16:52] <someblueguyinchat> YAAAAA-HOO-HOO-HOOIE
[16:53] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Nope, only re-spec is medbay on Tempest.
[16:53] <neoshingo> Hi limes on my way home now from work limesRun limesCheer
[16:53] <dawnyan> I think the idea is that you take the skill to make Nova spammable and drain shields, so you compensate with shield drain on Annihilate
[16:53] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> It's a combo of all three trees Limealicious.
[16:53] <mrrussellthestone> Haev a good one Neo
[16:53] <tene21> oh, the explorer profile? that gets you boosts across the board and your dash turns into a blink
[16:53] <superultrameg> It's so weird to hear that people are now just going home from work seeing as it's almost 23:00 here
[16:53] <drakanov32> I feel weird because it's a WIP and a lot of people I chat have probably already seen a previous version due to the booru but I thought you'd appreciate it 😅
[16:54] <superultrameg> Timezones, fuck yea
[16:54] <ha1lucinate> hi I'm just tuning in can you briefly talk about the classes and their powers... it looks like you're a biotic
[16:54] <neoshingo> Ty limes using seal power to get home limesSplash
[16:54] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Try re-spec into all trees to unlock the first tier of it and you will see.
[16:54] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Yes.
[16:54] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Worth.
[16:54] <tene21> i hotswap between profiles depending on what i want to do tbh
[16:54] <tene21> but i like the blink
[16:54] <tene21> lets me get through the enemy's cover
[16:54] <tiphias> Pathfinder, this area can be mined for resources
[16:54] <tene21> without having to go over or around
[16:55] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Oh... That Vetra quest is for locking in her romance ;-;
[16:55] <superultrameg> I can't be the only one that only knows Mass Effect because of the memes about it
[16:55] <turtstv> limesWomp
[16:55] <drakanov32> I tweeted it lol
[16:55] <dawnyan> We need to talk about Kevin

[16:55] <turtstv> FailFish
[16:55] <drakanov32> why is she still smiling while saying that? lol
[16:55] <tene21> rude
[16:55] <lordshaid> When Limes said 'Drakanov' I swear I heard 'jackinoff'
[16:55] <someblueguyinchat> That facepalm looked so weird
[16:56] <annybody> i think she is blind
[16:56] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Well... If we delete his lines of codes he dies.
[16:56] <mrrussellthestone> What's the verdict chat, do you trust SAM
[16:56] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Yes.
[16:56] <mrrussellthestone> I kinda don't
[16:56] <ha1lucinate> good talk
[16:56] <dawnyan> I do
[16:56] <easy_d> SAM is evil is totally gonna be a plot twist
[16:56] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Unless it comes to jokes.
[16:56] <superultrameg> I don't know who SAM is so i'm gonna say yes
[16:56] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> I don't trust SAM with jokes.

[16:58] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> I might remember the order wrong but this is how the line goes Limealicious ; Liam starts, then Suvi, Vetra, Jaal, Lexi and ending with Liam.
[16:58] <turtstv> woah i cant wait to participate in movie night

[16:58] <eternallineage> Moana!! time for revStop
[16:58] <skinny_mario> It's still in your head, I see.
[16:58] <drakanov32> What day? Thursday? I'll bring my good hat :D
[16:59] <superultrameg> Wait next thursday as in like tomorrow, or next week
[16:59] <lordshaid> And Limes. You poor poor sap. You were just humming MK8. It's scarred deeper than we thought
[16:59] <doormatt232> I had the soundtrack playing while I was driving today direPig I did this to myself
[16:59] <mrrussellthestone> !discord
[16:59] <moobot> Are you a sub of Limes? You can join the both the special seal discord and Vinesauce sub Discord! Connection information - http://imgur.com/a/y2rwD Discord syncs with Twitch every ~hour, so check back later if the server doesn't show initially!
[16:59] <tene21> @Superultrameg next week
[16:59] <mrrussellthestone> Gotta join the discord if you wanna join movie night bois
[16:59] <dawnyan> oh you're not trying Annihilation?
[16:59] <mrrussellthestone> Also, we are taking suggestions for more movies
[16:59] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> But you suck at aiming :p
[16:59] <mrrussellthestone> The Warcraft movie was floating around
[17:00] <superultrameg> @tene21 Again, thank you! I've yet to join the Limes Discord so i was just wondering
[17:00] <superultrameg> Warcraft's pretty good
[17:00] <dawnyan> 1v1 no ults
[17:00] <dawnyan> no summs
[17:00] <tene21> warcraft would probably go over the head of a lot of the chat, i've heard it assumes you know a lot about the lore already
[17:00] <lordshaid> I've never seen Warcraft or Moana, so I'd be happy with either! Especially since now I'm trying out WoW
[17:01] <doormatt232> The Warcraft movie gives a very basic run down of a lot the major things you need to know to enjoy the movies story
[17:01] <tene21> while any biotic effect is active on an enemy
[17:01] <kingspunf> I feel like people shat on Warcraft. From what i´ve seen, it´s not bad
[17:01] <superultrameg> Having never played Warcraft it honestly didn't feel like it assumes you know a lot about the lore
[17:01] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> It means you have extra shields while something like the black hole thing is having an enemy pulled in.
[17:02] <mrrussellthestone> I watched it in the cinema
[17:02] <mrrussellthestone> It was fun
[17:02] <skinny_mario> That's the case much of the time, honestly.
[17:02] <superultrameg> What other movie suggestions have there been?
[17:02] <dawnyan> lots
[17:02] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Limes, spec into the other trees a little to see Explorer, judge for yourself if the bonuses it gives are worth it.
[17:02] <walkfree101> I think it works while an effect is on... but some effects are immediate, so I don't know
[17:02] <someblueguyinchat> Several reviews I saw basically had on a guest that knew a lot about Warcraft to provide their input
[17:02] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Damage.
[17:02] <moobot> For stream updates and ferret pictures follow me on Twitter! https://twitter.com/Limesalicious
[17:03] <dawnyan> I want to say damage, but that depends on how much you rely on Charge
[17:03] <jimmyrbob> damage sounds good
[17:03] <superultrameg> My girlfriend is a huge Warcraft nerd so she loved the movie but even as a non-Warcraft fan i quite liked it as well
[17:03] <walkfree101> Gosh... some of the power descriptions are so cryptic.
[17:04] <dawnyan> Detonation

[17:09] <tene21> to be fair your adept is rank 4
[17:09] <lordshaid> WoW is such a big download. I thought my computer had finished it but it's still like 30 GB away. And I know it's playable but I want to wait till it hits optimal so I don't ruin my experience
[17:09] <someblueguyinchat> I can only take so much cute before my body rejects it
[17:09] <doormatt232> See that in the chat box? Noyau cries? That is proof of my suffering. They did that to me
[17:09] <tene21> you're comparing rank 4 adept to rank 2 explorer LUL
[17:09] <superultrameg> JoJo is best anime
[17:09] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Well with Explorer your shotgun does more damage and you take less as well :p

[17:27] <esn87> As a poll please chat 1 for "yes" or 0 for "no":would a future Mass Effect title with accurate human facial expression cause you to commit more human money to EA?

[17:28] <blabeep> ^ what these guys said
[17:28] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> I could care less about facial animations as long the game itself is good.
[17:28] <easy_d> I vote 2
[17:28] <chainsawjoe32> 0 i never played mass effect to begin with
[17:28] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> I don't care if EA is the publisher, Sony, Microsoft etc.

[17:29] <turtstv> limesFirst
[17:30] <tene21> like the effect of your restoration power
[17:30] <someblueguyinchat> I think it's fair to notice a pattern with a developer/publisher and make your choices on whether or not to buy a game according to that pattern
[17:30] <dawnyan> "It increases the shields/health gained via powers."
[17:30] <xenuceratops> @Easy_D well, how far do you go with that line of thinking, right? Do you care how they treat their employees, etc.?
[17:30] <nokkosjumala> hi friends
[17:30] <esn87> I thank all humans for your feedback, it will be analyzed and considered
[17:30] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Everyone do and do not do a lot of things for their own reason and we should all respect that :3
[17:31] <xenuceratops> @Easy_D i'm not buying EA until the voice actor strike is over, for instance.
[17:31] <dawnyan> this game needs a training dummy
[17:31] <turtstv> I don't play any video games because all game developres are evil.
[17:31] <hedobot> thing is, not many companies treat the employees well.
[17:31] <turtstv> you need a garrison with a dummy in it in this game
[17:31] <hedobot> it's a sad fact
[17:32] <xenuceratops> @Limealicious this game came out pre-strike
[17:32] <blabeep> scurge
[17:32] <xenuceratops> @TurtsTV is going all scortched earth over here
[17:32] <airjulio> yeah for a game that doesn't really have top-name VA talent, it's really good.
[17:32] <ajajajaj5> i dont leave my house because the government us corrupt
[17:32] <lordshaid> I only have the starter version, but is the full version of WoW still a monthly payment? Or one-time payments for each DLC? Or both?

[17:33] <doormatt232> Isn't it pretty common knowledge at this point that a lot of developers/publishers treat their employees kinda shittily? Like of course it doesn't make it right, but if you are going to just call EA out on it, you need to call everyone out on it
[17:33] <turtstv> You don't need Legion until you get to that point in the game so you only need the base game + a sub

[18:15] <mrrussellthestone> Wow deep
[18:15] <willyahm19> too deep for me
[18:15] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Some of the perks are locked behind viability.
[18:15] <velocirapity> It's just a cutscene where the colonists go "hey its more viable now" i think you need to kill some kett outposts
[18:16] <lusetifan_shadowdrako> Maybe it's under Tempest?

[19:07] <jysuscryst> allaHi everyone!
[19:07] <topazshot88> I can't help but hear "SHUT UP" from Link a lot.
[19:07] <mrrussellthestone> Hoi Jysus
[19:07] <topazshot88> No Link, that's what others say about you.
[19:07] <morings> Oh you did? Whoops I must not have been paying attention
[19:07] <topazshot88> THIEVED
[19:07] <topazshot88> On the bright side of things, if it had happened a bit later, you'd be stuck in the sandpit.
[19:08] <morings> You went from hero to zero so fast :(
[19:08] <masterkade> what does that 8 powerup do?

[19:09] <dawnyan> weight affects acceleration and how much you get bumped from stuff. traction is how much force it takes to turn. handling is how well you turn

[19:16] <mario1080p> for future reference @Limealicious , I suggest you turn off "Code Required" so people that has raced with you can enter without having to enter a code.
[19:16] <bombthemuscindustry> Can't wait to get this game so I can throw away me salt shakers once and for all
[19:16] <willyahm19> limesHmm

[19:21] <mrrussellthestone> We get an extra hour of streaming
[19:21] <turtstv> if we get 10/10 subs we cause Cpt_Barricade to suffer
[19:21] <dawnyan> I think it might be 5
[19:21] <turtstv> so lets get to 10/10
