[16:42] <retro_specter_parker> There is a certain... something about TF2's gameplay.

[16:43] <slugnut> @Mahbonk Same. The community aspect, somethingI feel Overwatch is lacking in, made TF2 excellent with custom servers and such.
[16:43] <hedobot> limesChamp
[16:43] <mrrussellthestone> RitaFree
[16:43] <exyoh> Outta the space dumpster, boys.

[16:44] <dessart> They should reboot TF2 as Team Fortress. Get rid of all the feature creep.
[16:44] <tunanoot> i met a power ranger not too long ago
[16:44] <hedobot> remix :vv
[16:44] <mario1080p> "Stronger than before~"
[16:44] <xifihas> Oh hey, it's a medley of PR intros.
[16:44] <tene21> i'm gonna meet the original cast in september
[16:44] <skinny_mario> @tene21 That's cool.
[16:44] <tunanoot> i think i met Johnny Bosch
[16:44] <retro_specter_parker> I remember little bab me thinking Rita Repulsa was attractive.
[16:44] <epltaph> @Tene21 They added ranked servers, but they haven't rebalanced the game or changed anything to make competitive TF2 anything very deep.
[16:44] <exyoh> Oh no, I hope it's not a mash-up of ALL of them.
[16:44] <slugnut> @Dessart People have been asking Valve for years for vanilla TF2 and to this day nothing. BibleThump
[16:44] <exyoh> They get so bad after a while.
[16:44] <rapbert> !currentsong
[16:44] <moobot> Jamming out to "Power Rangers Theme Mash-Up*Updated*(MMPR to PRNSteel)", requested by pr0bait
[16:44] <tunanoot> and he was green ranger twice and a black ranger once
[16:45] <skinny_mario> HEROES NEVER DIE
[16:45] <silonnuke> Fokin loved Super sentai back in the day
[16:45] <epltaph> Don't get me wrong btw, I love TF2, it just isn't really designed around competitive play.
[16:45] <rapbert> oh god it is a mashup of all of them
[16:45] <osomister> ju-aaah
[16:45] <dawnyan> jus-
[16:45] <keavis> TF2 is good for burst fun
[16:45] <retro_specter_parker> Toku Sentai > Super Sentai
[16:45] <dessart> @SlugNut As much as I enjoyed Vanilla TF2, I don't think is the way to go in this day and age.
[16:45] <skinny_mario> @slugnut Big developers: "Vanilla? Who would want it?"
[16:45] <retro_specter_parker> Whhhhh
[16:45] <dawnyan> LUL
[16:45] <mrrussellthestone> Go seal limesFirst
[16:45] <dawnyan> I'm more surprised you survived that initially
[16:45] <osomister> they saw you
[16:45] <keavis> But nowadays I dont really like the way it's set up, and people are either really quick to be angry or they're just playing to fuck around
[16:45] <dickmandrake> Yeah, all TF2 matchmaking did was force people to wait to join servers full of toxic players
[16:45] <von_ragnar> Roofie gun
[16:46] <retro_specter_parker> What the fuck was that? vinejoelTrash
[16:46] <osomister> toxic(tm)
[16:46] <dickmandrake> You don't even get anything for competivie TF" other than XP, which does nothing
[16:46] <osomister> please shap
[16:46] <dessart> @EPlTAPH I feel the same way about OW. I hope that their push for esports don't end up creating the mentality you see in MOBAs.
[16:46] <nokkosjumala> I tried Overwatch once. It was so terrifying I decided maybe online multiplayer games just aren't for me. limesRun
[16:46] <mahlazerprod> Time Force! PogChamp
[16:46] <nokkosjumala> Random people all over the world telling me to kill myself wasn't really an experience I need in my life.
[16:46] <ctrlshiftkill> valve doesn't seem to put as much time into it these days. they just kind of wait around for the community to make things so they can put out creates and make more money
[16:46] <dawnyan> that 4 man mercy res PogChamp
[16:46] <chi369> PogChamp
[16:46] <exyoh> Wild Force is where I check out.
[16:46] <mrrussellthestone> GO GO
[16:46] <tene21> wild force PogChamp
[16:46] <retro_specter_parker> I like most that you get periodic loot crates in OW....for free. That are openable. For free.

[16:46] <chi369> the comeback
[16:46] <chi369> crendorGG
[16:46] <tene21> jungle fury was the last good one tbh
[16:46] <mahlazerprod> Well, yes. TF2 Matchmaking was a mistake from Valve
[16:46] <retro_specter_parker> That pissed me off in TF2
[16:46] <cpt_barricade> easy
[16:46] <dawnyan> limesFirst
[16:46] <tene21> tpGG
[16:46] <mrrussellthestone> YAY
[16:46] <cpt_barricade> thanks power rangers
[16:47] <keavis> brizziBM
[16:47] <exyoh> The Wildforce red ranger killed his roommate with a sword.
[16:47] <slugnut> @Nokkosjumala Did that happen? I don't think that's ever happened to me.
[16:47] <martypcsr> the power of super sentai MorphinTime

[16:47] <eren_yaehger> Roadhog has nipple rings
[16:47] <rawketlawnchair0> That was a good play
[16:47] <skinny_mario> @retro_specter_parker Oh dear, that really is terrible.
[16:47] <cpt_barricade> Only 4 more sub points PogChamp
[16:47] <retro_specter_parker> @Eren_Yaehger He got them when he was young and reckless.
[16:47] <dickmandrake> Valve spent 2 years developing matchmaking, completely balls its up and now people don't want to play anymore 4Head
[16:47] <theluigiguy> limesFirst limesFirst limesFirst limesFirst
[16:48] <cpt_barricade> That's like 1 $25 sub PogChamp
[16:48] <chi369> barri what rank are you in ow

[16:48] <dullahan2408> @Limealicious if someone subscribes for a higher dollar amount, does that count towards it?
[16:48] <czbacklash> limesShare
[16:48] <edwardthehazardous> Hey, be right back.
[16:48] <dawnyan> yeah
[16:48] <cpt_barricade> what are you chi?
[16:48] <dawnyan> 5$ is 1 point, 9$ is 2 points, 25$ is 6 points
[16:48] <retro_specter_parker> BLESS YOU
[16:48] <chi369> I hit diamond at the pc cafe while waiting for my laptop to be repaired
[16:49] <retro_specter_parker> I am a thirsty boy.
[16:49] <cpt_barricade> $5 = 1 sub point, $10 = 2 sub points $25 = 6 sub points
[16:49] <ctrlshiftkill> valve knows how to make money though. you buy keys from them, trade items for keys, sell those keys on the market (which valve takes a cut) to get an unusual (which needed a key to get and valve gets more) or a game (which valve gets a cut)
[16:49] <nokkosjumala> @SlugNut Yeah, I mean I know it's probably just bad luck with matchmaking and not the default experience, but it bummed me out to be worth it.
[16:49] <cpt_barricade> nice duder
[16:49] <chi369> it's been at repair for 3 weeks
[16:49] <retro_specter_parker> (no joke, I am dehydrated as sin)

[17:48] <mckinzie> CurseLit limesFirst CurseLit
[17:48] <rubix117> Why has this game got a story?
[17:48] <mckinzie> TwitchLit limesFirst TwitchLit
[17:48] <mahbonk> alright i'm gonna go outside for a bit
[17:48] <blabeep> I can totally relate to Tee
[17:48] <rubix117> WHAT IS HAPPENING?
[17:48] <mahbonk> Do your best!
[17:48] <theluigiguy> he's a T piece LUL
[17:49] <fledglingzombie> this is all tetris canon right?
[17:49] <epltaph> Tetris definitely needed a story.
[17:49] <tunanoot> who in chat would wanna eat a puyo
[17:49] <dawnyan> why is she holding an apple
[17:49] <easy_d> Puyoooooooooooo
06[17:49] * mckinzie raises hand
[17:49] <blabeep> definitely
[17:49] <loaderb0t> The DEPTH of this conversation! limesChamp
[17:49] <von_ragnar> Shouldn't he have a russian accent?
[17:49] <dawnyan> is she going to eat the apple
[17:49] <kerokaraoke> Ringo is japanese for Apple
[17:49] <retro_specter_parker> @Little_bun Thank you limesLove
[17:49] <blabeep> never
[17:49] <tunanoot> i think puyos would taste good
[17:49] <epltaph> I would consume puyo
[17:49] <isghj> girl holding apple called ringo...
[17:49] <skinny_mario> Is the dialogue like this in the Japanese version as well?
[17:49] <fledglingzombie> no she just always has an apple because of her name
[17:49] <tene21> what
[17:49] <easy_d> guys if 4 puyos of the same colour touch in your stomach you die
[17:49] <xifihas> Because anime.
[17:49] <rubix117> We fought I trust you
[17:49] <someblueguyinchat> I'm just imagining the original programmers behind Tetris looking at this and looking so goddamn confused.
[17:49] <rasetsu_0> Pokemon logic
[17:49] <will99222> dey gon get 2getha
[17:49] <kingspunf> I wish that Ringo just sounded like fucking Ringo Starr. No other change, just the voice
[17:49] <geggin> anime!
[17:49] <dawnyan> we played tetris - puyo so I feel like I can trust you now
[17:49] <theluigiguy> Together VoHiYo
[17:49] <ominousbagel> Wait. Tetris is an anime now?
[17:50] <rubix117> @KingSpunf Thomas the tank engine up in here
[17:50] <cpt_barricade> we made a friend
[17:50] <fledglingzombie> correct
[17:50] <von_ragnar> Seriously, that dialogues must be written on purpose
[17:50] <isghj> The power of friendship Keppo
[17:50] <easy_d> I'm so glad this came out in the west after all
[17:50] <retro_specter_parker> Ringo = Apple in japanese, but also it ties with her knowledge, being a scholar. Apples and knowledge go hand in hand, in symbolism
[17:50] <mrrussellthestone> A new stage PogChamp
[17:50] <tene21> yeah ringo is japanese for apple
[17:50] <easy_d> what the hell did SEGA have to do to license Tetris in the west?
[17:50] <retro_specter_parker> Notably, forbidden knowledge.
[17:50] <fledglingzombie> tetris lessons!
[17:50] <ajajajaj5> learning is 4 nerds

[17:50] <retro_specter_parker> Just two puyos, nerd <3 @Limealicious
[17:50] <skinny_mario> @easy_d Ubisoft made a game as well recently. I guess the owners of Tetris lend it out to different developers/publishers.

[17:51] <von_ragnar> Kaidan drop as well
[17:51] <easy_d> like for a couple years EA had the rights
[17:51] <cpt_barricade> how many times do ya reckon Limes says that welcome message a year limesHmm
[17:51] <easy_d> can you use the chalkboard theme in the main game? It looks amazing
[17:51] <ajajajaj5> 500 times
[17:51] <retro_specter_parker> PRETTY SNEAKY, SIS
[17:51] <ink_root> yes you can

[17:52] <skinny_mario> Also, hi Aj.

[17:52] <fledglingzombie> it's really weird
[17:52] <little_bun> Bye bye @retro_specter_parker !
[17:53] <easy_d> @skinny_mario yea but the entire reason this didn't come out before was because SEGA didn't have the license in the west

[17:54] <cpt_barricade> :(
[17:54] <will99222> why does tetris has a story
[17:54] <easy_d> This voice acting is gr8
[17:54] <rubix117> This is so Kawai
[17:54] <dawnyan> is that a Kid's Next Door character
[17:54] <mastergiegue> they're T and S blocks
[17:54] <blabeep> lul rip
[17:54] <xifihas> Ess needs a beatdown.
[17:54] <mckinzie> It sounds like you voice acted this game, Aisha.
[17:54] <fred> don't do puyo's kids
[17:54] <geggin> pop those puyos
[17:54] <doormatt232> When did Tetris get so anime limesHi I'm scared
[17:54] <fledglingzombie> the millenials are all popping puyos, it's an epidemic
[17:54] <dawnyan> "popping puyos" sounds like a euphemism for drugs
[17:54] <tunanoot> every girl sounds fucking identical
[17:54] <dawnyan> limesHmm
[17:54] <von_ragnar> Little known fact: Limes are nor very good at tetris. Might have to do with lack of opposable thumbs. Or finers. Or hands
[17:54] <fledglingzombie> beat you to it dawn :p
[17:55] <dawnyan> meep
[17:55] <easy_d> Ess means Ace in Swedish 🤔
[17:55] <mario1080p> It's really interesting to see a pro Tetris player take on a pro Puyo player even though Tetris has a huge advantage by their speed.
[17:55] <von_ragnar> Not Limes, seals
[17:55] <theluigiguy> Pipipi

[18:38] <kwimbob> oh, if you ever See a Big Puyo: you can change it's color (with the rotate buttons) btw
[18:38] <osomister> this is robotnik's mean bean machine
[18:39] <pramina> you almost got a 2 chain P
[18:39] <limitofx> i knew it. my lewdness detector was going off the charts
[18:39] <titatitanium> i think the same can be said for most of us tbh
[18:39] <rubix117> I think there is a sonic version of pooyo
[18:39] <easy_d> No the Robotnik game was Puyo Puyo
[18:39] <th3sharkk> the puyos are cute

[18:39] <honeynut1> its all about getting the combos
[18:39] <jetstreamscarf> Tetris is a lot easier than Tetris, but chaining in Puyopuyo is a really good feeling.
[18:39] <evan__m> you gotta get them combos
[18:39] <makorelfish> it's kirby's avalanche

[18:40] <char1zard52> Puyo
[18:40] <sainvt> Puyo <3
[18:40] <jeboboid> tetris, I'm really good at tetris
[18:40] <tene21> doctor robotnik's mean bean machine
[18:40] <titatitanium> i mean puyo is probably easier
[18:40] <evan__m> but sweet jesus chaining is so good in puyo
[18:40] <mr_tsareena> Puyo <3
[18:40] <limitofx> i haven't tried puyo, so tetris i guess
[18:40] <titatitanium> but if tetris was color-based that would be hell
[18:40] <rasetsu_0> Tetris
[18:40] <skinny_mario> I actually really like Puyo Puyo.
[18:40] <nebulalegacy> titris.
[18:40] <osomister> tetris. simiply because i'm so familiar with it. but this game is why i want the switch
[18:40] <baconingot> clearing them to get to controls
[18:40] <tunanoot> puyo is good
[18:40] <syndaris> Love them both, but better at Tetris by a longshot
[18:40] <mrrussellthestone> Dr Robotniks Mean Bean Machine
[18:40] <dawnyan> New sub PogChamp
[18:40] <kwimbob> Puyo is interesting to watch because you wanna stack high intentionally
[18:40] <makorelfish> tetris is easier but I like how I have so much room to get better at puyo

[18:40] <tunanoot> yay!
[18:40] <tekthenerd> Puyo is a lot of fun honestly
[18:40] <rasetsu_0> Tetris simply because it's entertaining watching others panic over it Kappa
[18:40] <omgimsue> It's why I subbed :3
[18:40] <skinny_mario> @makorelfish Hey, Makorel.
[18:40] <omgimsue> Hello chat !
[18:40] <evan__m> puyo is really fun trying to set up combos in puyo
[18:41] <evan__m> until garbage stacks up
[18:41] <evan__m> and fucks everything
[18:41] <mrrussellthestone> Hello Omg limeeHi
[18:41] <easy_d> Another thing is that the puyos aren't stuck together, so if one is hanging over the edge it falls down
[18:41] <skaarridley> You on the left?
[18:41] <mrrussellthestone> limesHi
[18:41] <osomister> Elbits?
[18:41] <limitofx> i'm not sure what's going on, but i think you're getting rekt
[18:41] <easy_d> Meteos Switch please
[18:41] <kwimbob> But Tetris feels better to PLAY meself, feels good to stack perfectly (and puyo sometimes feels like you accidentally combo'd, if you're new)
[18:41] <hedobot> Collumns?

[18:54] <tunanoot> theyre in MIDDLE SCHOOL?
[18:54] <skinny_mario> It's a masterpiece.

[18:55] <titatitanium> bye youtube
[18:55] <ecrelia> Story is alright, I'm caught up in the subplot between the'O' character and the dog, when he gets yipped
[18:55] <mario1080p> that carbuncle expression should be an emote
[18:55] <tunanoot> oh good its moptop

[18:55] <chainsawjoe32> yes
[18:55] <titatitanium> please punch maguro

[18:55] <easy_d> He's jealous! ⭐
[18:55] <th3sharkk> what is the star punctuation mark
[18:55] <samiam1616> A Kendama?
[18:55] <osomister> yesi think
[18:55] <crazyenzo03> there is also a risk of someone appearing to be a favorite because someone got a fancier thank you message.
[18:55] <easy_d> yeah it is
[18:55] <jetstreamscarf> indeed it is.
[18:55] <ctrlshiftkill> but no one is waking up late and running with toast in their mouth
[18:55] <chainsawjoe32> i actually own one
[18:55] <nerinai> also i like the limecult so thats nice
[18:55] <hedobot> is it a gavel?
[18:55] <titatitanium> he looks like an earthbound character
[18:55] <1defix> I wish I could use star signs while I talk
[18:55] <hedobot> is he a Judge?
[18:55] <dawnyan> ppreciate the support
[18:55] <sainvt> what is that?
[18:55] <greygull> Having a phrase to use for something like "thanks for subscribing" is the same reason why people usually have the same greeting when they answer a phone call, because otherwise you drop spaghetti like crazy.
[18:55] <kingspunf> Kendama
[18:55] <dawnyan> god bless
[18:55] <orangewill> Why does he end his sentences with stars....?
[18:55] <dawnyan> much love
[18:55] <chainsawjoe32> it has an Eyeball ball
[18:55] <1defix> thats a Kandama
[18:55] <dawnyan> my friend

[18:56] <titatitanium> No Thanks.
[18:56] <kwimbob> T-SPINS
[18:56] <cpt_barricade> guess i didn't t-spin right
[18:56] <dawnyan> its when you spin your T
[18:56] <pramina> oh boy limes
[18:56] <doormatt232> Thats a pretty far drop for them all to wake up on the ground, how are they alive limesPup
[18:56] <arras01> Do the tutorials to find out
[18:56] <makorelfish> t-gasm
[18:56] <th3sharkk> T-spins are when you spin a t block into place
[18:56] <imasuka> WutFace
[18:57] <soltakama> SPINK ATTACK
[18:57] <1defix> Tetris DRIFT
[18:57] <samiam1616> T-Spin is basically that fancy move where they kajigger a piece to fit in an awkward hole
[18:57] <easy_d> OMG there's a teaser for the animated Netflix Castlevania series and it looks cool as shit
[18:57] <limitofx> aw yeah, top tier tetris techniques
[18:57] <xifihas> Rotate a T block to fit it in a place you can't normally get it.
[18:57] <jetstreamscarf> A T-Spin is dificult is what it is.
[18:57] <dawnyan> LUL
[18:57] <mario1080p> Pros do most of those techniques @Limealicious
[18:57] <kwimbob> It's why Tee's weapon is literally a Fidget Spinner Kappa
[18:57] <th3sharkk> aisha you messed up already
[18:57] <samiam1616> Specifically the T block I guess
[18:57] <baconingot> t spin are way beyond your level
[18:57] <dawnyan> RIP
[18:57] <nebulalegacy> C L A P
[18:57] <ctrlshiftkill> @greygull shit i write down what I'm going to say before a phone call for work
[18:57] <tene21> t-spin is when you rotate something around a gap to fit it somewhere it wouldn't go when dropped straight
[18:57] <dawnyan> watch the pro at work
[18:57] <tekthenerd> T-spin is a way to fit a T block by spinning it it into place.
[18:57] <masterkade> a t-spin is where you rotate a T piece to get into a hole it can't normally reach BloodTrail
[18:57] <linkykos> Hello Limes, hi chat
[18:57] <tacoman1320x> T-Spins are how you end up crying in your sleep at night.
[18:57] <th3sharkk> @Tene21 yeah pretty much
[18:57] <limitofx> get good at tetris nerd
[18:57] <super_gigidibi> T-spin is a pro-level teabag Kappa
[18:57] <tunanoot> a T-Spin killed my family
[18:57] <samiam1616> Like, Tetris blocks don't necessarily lock when they're touching another block, so during that time you just rotate it a bunch so that it would fit
[18:57] <ctrlshiftkill> the original fidget spinners
[18:57] <cpt_barricade> PJSalt
[18:58] <limitofx> A T-Spin is my family

[18:58] <dawnyan> Salted it PJSalt
[18:58] <greygull> @CtrlShiftKill one of my previous jobs was at a call center, and after the first few months the initial four minutes of a conversation were COMPLETELY memorized for me.
[18:58] <limitofx> i had no idea
[18:58] <arras01> It's Sine
[18:58] <titatitanium> excited SIGH
[18:58] <evan__m> she says like trig shit
[18:58] <tunanoot> S U C C
[18:58] <evan__m> she says sine
[18:58] <orangewill> I think she said sine
[18:58] <titatitanium> SIN(X)
[18:58] <dawnyan> Hey welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger, how can I help you?
[18:58] <evan__m> cosine and tangent and other shit
[18:58] <samiam1616> Solved, Sine, Cosine, Tangent, then ALGORITHMS
[18:58] <kingspunf> PSY
[18:58] <kwimbob> sine wave, SIN(x)
[18:58] <moqak> maybe psy?

[18:59] <dawnyan> Tangent Kreygasm
[18:59] <tekthenerd> She does
[18:59] <th3sharkk> is it based on the number of lines?
[18:59] <mario1080p> she does @Limealicious !!!
[18:59] <super_gigidibi> TANGENTS!! muhGasm
[18:59] <honeynut1> shes a brainiac

[18:59] <imasuka> Ringo is the best
[18:59] <th3sharkk> yup that was cosine
[18:59] <banjofries> Sine and co sine is just flipping algebra thingies
[18:59] <theluigiguy> Cosine!
[18:59] <titatitanium> COSECANT
[18:59] <samiam1616> With Puyo, the lines are based on combos, in Tetris, I guess it's either based on lines, back-to-back clears, or some combination of both
[18:59] <samiam1616> The voice lines that is
[18:59] <ajajajaj5> simple geometry
[18:59] <theluigiguy> LUL
[19:00] <greygull> I'm not sure if this game has voice lines for back-to-backs.
[19:00] <orangewill> LUL
[19:00] <dawnyan> is she going to yell "Sec Squared" too? limesHmm
[19:00] <easy_d> his name was Sho Minaminoto iirc
[19:00] <kwimbob> Is an 8 combo: DIVIDE BY 0? 🤔
[19:00] <samiam1616> What controller are you using for this?
[19:00] <limitofx> no, i think his name was fuck me
[19:00] <tene21> FUCK ME was my favourite character
[19:00] <easy_d> Spelling is up in the air
[19:00] <tunanoot> Fuck me is the best villain
[19:00] <tene21> @samiam1616 pro controller probably
[19:00] <cpt_barricade> limes is a swearing sailor moon2FEELS

[19:00] <dawnyan> such a potty mouth direFeels
[19:00] <sunra__> what if your name was actually Fuck Me limesHmm
[19:00] <samiam1616> Locking pieces is always helpful, though sometimes it just kind of makes you pick your poison
[19:00] <orangewill> What is even happening
[19:00] <cpt_barricade> moon2L
[19:00] <kingspunf> wow, you´re goofin bad
[19:00] <sunra__> that would make for some interesting situations
[19:00] <limitofx> @sunra__ i mean, the pickup lines write themselves
[19:00] <dawnyan> "hi, fuck me"
[19:00] <dawnyan> "how are you"
[19:01] <tunanoot> maybe someone in china has a name like Fuk Mei

[19:02] <titatitanium> does Apple Human know more than trigonometric functions
[19:02] <limitofx> they're just blowing off steam if i recall the cutscene
[19:02] <limitofx> correctly
[19:02] <samiam1616> This is actually to help him blow off steam
[19:02] <tekthenerd> So he can calm down
[19:02] <samiam1616> And also teach you how to be good at Tetrtis
[19:02] <tacoman1320x> You gotta trust in the Heart of the Puyos.
[19:02] <pramina> and ringo wants to play tetris also
[19:02] <lousaic> hey im here

[19:05] <kwimbob> @TitaTitanium yeah... Tetris is really mechanical and it's your fault if you mess up (they punish from the bottom). Puyo is more fun if you're new to 'em both
[19:05] <skinny_mario> You're a fucking liar, Limes.
[19:05] <keavis> I know people who swear like a fucking League of Legends player, and he lies like nothing else
[19:05] <cpt_barricade> nobody has ever bullied in this chat
[19:05] <keavis> A person*
[19:05] <ctrlshiftkill> wen were you when soil die
[19:05] <soltakama> no offense but youre terrible for some slow paced tetris
[19:05] <beekaaaay> "tend"
[19:05] <doormatt232> This is a no bully chat uwu
[19:05] <tacoman1320x> I wanna get back on the Puyo Ship.

[19:05] <cpt_barricade> It's her 3rd time playing the game lol
[19:05] <th3sharkk> no you have to save the l piece until you have a tetris situation set up
[19:05] <titatitanium> @kwimbob like what i'm going for though is that like after fucking up all the remaining time is just a stress-filled waste of time
[19:05] <sunra__> i have a lemon you can have that
[19:05] <th3sharkk> oh whatever
[19:05] <tekthenerd> Isnt tangent only for Puyo?
[19:05] <dawnyan> no offense but you're rude limesPup
[19:05] <ctrlshiftkill> we'll twist the fuck outta them

[19:06] <soltakama> Limes, what is the inverse tangent of PI/2?
[19:06] <samiam1616> It's mind-boggling how good those tetris masters can get
[19:06] <tunanoot> pwease no steppu
[19:06] <th3sharkk> i apologize

[19:09] <evan__m> @th3sharkk apparently the spin attack refers to the way you can spin a t piece in tetris to fit in a gap
[19:09] <rubix117> Awww you earned one credit
[19:09] <kwimbob> @Dawnyan can you even imagine ProPlayer's watching the bar at the top for Attacks and intentionally counter-attacking -- or intentionally completing combos at times to ruin their opponent's side? NotLikeThis
[19:09] <th3sharkk> that up to fall is really annoying
[19:09] <titatitanium> tetris IS hell
[19:09] <keavis> Honestly Doormatt232, the best one is just the old Gameboy one on the 3DS shop

[19:21] <mahbonk> oh my
[19:21] <rasetsu_0> because Ringo means Apple
[19:21] <titatitanium> combo chains are too hard in puyo
[19:21] <tekthenerd> Puyo just takes some practice tbh
[19:21] <pepperyena> You get used to them
[19:22] <skinny_mario> @toxarocks1 Go away, you shithole. I saw some of you during Vinny's stream last night. You're doing a very bad thing, and I don't condone it in the slightest.
[19:22] <baconingot> the frces help with combos
[19:22] <tekthenerd> They get less repetitive once you start getting used to chains
[19:22] <doormatt232> Don't worry about it Mario limesLove moobot took care of it
[19:22] <mahbonk> please don't feed it
[19:22] <mahbonk> feed sky instead
[19:22] <snivy4164> What is the bot doing?
[19:22] <titatitanium> i get the impression that the only way to win in puyo is to do chains... to the max

[19:23] <th3sharkk> that was fun
[19:23] <samiam1616> Yeah, Puyo's always about sick combos
[19:23] <tekthenerd> because Ringo is puyo character
[19:23] <dawnyan> Sky is an bottomless pit
[19:23] <pepperyena> Yes! Puyo Practice!
[19:23] <kwimbob> Pac Attack! p good!
[19:23] <mario1080p> The idea with Puyo is to fill up your board with Puyos to start a potential massive chain.
[19:23] <tunanoot> lol i suck at getting combos in puyo
[19:23] <limitofx> you're a puyo gal, so you gotta sufer in puyo hell
[19:23] <saucypuppetshow> Gotta be thinking ahead in this game

[19:24] <dr_brian> poor doggee Wowee
[19:24] <kwimbob> @Mario1080p yeah, puyo is fun to watch because they intentionally stack way high and then combo -- whereas Tetris is just mechanically impressive

[19:26] <th3sharkk> it's a big story
[19:26] <easy_d> What if Tee is his surname and his daddy is Mr. Tee
[19:26] <unamijo> @skinny_mario na he is just angry
[19:26] <tekthenerd> theres like 7 chapters with bonus ones
[19:26] <dawnyan> only 9.5% complete NotLikeThis
[19:26] <rasetsu_0> you'd think with what each set of characters run around with, they wouldn't find the other team weird
[19:26] <gurdesthurr> So uh... why is Ringo the only one not named after a letter?
[19:26] <easy_d> Is Jay a boy
[19:26] <titatitanium> this sound effect WutFace

[19:26] <th3sharkk> i guess
[19:26] <easy_d> TOIM FOR A MISCHIEF BATTLE
[19:26] <tekthenerd> @Gurdesthurr Ringo is a puyo character. Any character from the tetris team is named after a letter
[19:26] <omgimsue> DID SOMEONE SAY
[19:26] <omgimsue> MISCHIEF BATTLE?!
[19:27] <zlyle90> Yes, grab kids at a shopping center. Sounds like a good plan.

[19:27] <gurdesthurr> what the hell is puyo puyo?
[19:27] <omgimsue> PogChamp
[19:27] <unamijo> it will get fun when it forced you to chains
[19:27] <titatitanium> yeah that's the whole point right?
[19:27] <pepperyena> Puyo requires a little more looking ahead
[19:27] <dawnyan> happy feet PogChamp
[19:27] <albino_octopus> So what do these battles look like to the character?
[19:27] <th3sharkk> When Do We Get To Play Tetris Again: The Game

[19:28] <zlyle90> @saucy_chihuahua it is Wednesday my dude
[19:28] <kwimbob> Tetris Ship crashed, we're on Puyo Puyo Planet. FeelsBadMan RIP Tetris
[19:28] <titatitanium> i think it's the hair
[19:28] <metasighty> @Albino_Octopus the battle pretty much look exactly like what you see on the board, theyre putting blocks/puyos together and getting magic from exploding them
[19:28] <tekthenerd> If u want Puyo to be more interesting you should go to the tutorial room and check out some of the puyo setups.
[19:28] <th3sharkk> NotLikeThis whens tetris planet
[19:28] <dawnyan> their voice actor, Wendee Lee, has voiced a lot of anime characters limesPup
[19:28] <gurdesthurr> they remind of Yu tendo from beyblade
[19:28] <titatitanium> also limes your weeb is showing
[19:28] <albino_octopus> huh.
[19:28] <cpt_barricade> her weeb is always showing
[19:29] <metasighty> also yes, puyo is a lot more interesting once you understand the very basics of chaining
[19:29] <th3sharkk> I think the blobs morphing together is a nice aesthetic touch
[19:29] <dawnyan> Apparently she voices Bulma in Dragon Ball Super
[19:29] <dawnyan> yeah
[19:29] <th3sharkk> snake remember the basics of puyo puyo chaining
[19:29] <titatitanium> @Limealicious ARE YOU EXCITE FOR FEMALE SAIYANS
[19:29] <gurdesthurr> Super is "eh"
[19:29] <toxxymoxxy> wow lime is a WEEB Kappa
[19:29] <pepperyena> Is it unanimous that Jay and Elle are hated?
[19:29] <dawnyan> waaaaah limesRun
[19:30] <kwimbob> Yes.
[19:30] <tunanoot> i very much dislike them
[19:30] <doormatt232> Huh, she also voiced Bulma in the original Dragon Ball
[19:30] <cpt_barricade> yes you are
[19:30] <gurdesthurr> what dub?
[19:30] <cpt_barricade> !lie
[19:30] <moobot> Lying is wrong! Don't do it! https://www.myinstants.com/instant/dont-lie-11015/
[19:30] <dawnyan> If I wanted to watch Dragon Ball, where should I start? limesPup
[19:30] <jeboboid> Limes, you are SUCH a turboweeb
[19:30] <tunanoot> since they're twins, one of them was a mistake
[19:30] <electrodaddy> TURBO WEEB tangO
[19:30] <th3sharkk> mischief
[19:30] <dawnyan> from the very beginning?
[19:30] <cpt_barricade> watch Kai
[19:30] <dawnyan> would it take me 200 years? limesPup
[19:30] <jeboboid> I despise them
[19:30] <omgimsue> double mischief PogChamp
[19:30] <tekthenerd> I hate them
[19:30] <easy_d> Yes
[19:30] <pramina> nobody likes them
[19:30] <tunanoot> NO
[19:30] <albino_octopus> VoHiYo limesHi VoHiYo
[19:30] <skinny_mario> Everybody is a weeb. It's just that most don't accept it.
[19:30] <doormatt232> Yeah, Kai would be a better coice
[19:30] <easy_d> love 'em
[19:30] <doormatt232> choice*
[19:30] <ctrlshiftkill> weebilicious
[19:30] <easy_d> I. Love. Them.
[19:30] <rosewoes> i havent even played this game and i hate them
[19:30] <titatitanium> this game is my favorite character BigBrother
[19:30] <dawnyan> dub or sub? limesHmm
[19:30] <tekthenerd> Not even puyo fans liket hem
[19:30] <easy_d> BrokeBack
[19:30] <ajajajaj5> correct
[19:30] <foxesque> free them
[19:30] <th3sharkk> subble mischief
[19:31] <doormatt232> Hm...Dunno. How far along is Kai anyway? did it finish?
[19:31] <zlyle90> Stubble Mischief
[19:31] <kwimbob> In a world with both PI PI PI & GU GUUU, surely there could be no character more annoying, right? Kappa
[19:31] <gurdesthurr> Kai for animation and story, Ocean for one liners
[19:31] <foxesque> i just parse it as "salt"
[19:31] <tunanoot> the puyo in the bottom left corner is my favorite character
[19:31] <th3sharkk> does puyo puyo have a long multi-game spanning storyline?
[19:31] <mrrussellthestone> There's the business
[19:31] <titatitanium> kai is like redoing the original DBZ but in HD right
[19:32] <dawnyan> So I should start with Kai?
[19:32] <cpt_barricade> i think there's one more season left in kai's dub
[19:32] <th3sharkk> her tongue is a heart
[19:32] <metasighty> @th3sharkk technically the plot "reset" with the release of puyo puyo fever, but both before and after fever have ongoing storylines
[19:32] <th3sharkk> that can't be good
[19:32] <gurdesthurr> but way less filler
[19:32] <honeynut1> -3-
[19:32] <titatitanium> :w
[19:32] <kwimbob> o3o
[19:32] <tunanoot> my heart is a tongue
[19:32] <evan__m> '3'
[19:32] <pramina> Raffine PogChamp
[19:32] <doormatt232> Yeah, start with Kai Dawn, unless you want to watch the original Dragon ball. In which case, I hear its pretty well paced itself so limesHmm
[19:32] <cpt_barricade> If Buu saga is within ~26 episodes then maybe
[19:32] <rasetsu_0> *thinking sounds*
[19:32] <adammatthews93> Kai is with most of the filler cut and redone VA, still the same animation for the most part

[19:33] <ebrawl> and all that glitters is gold
[19:33] <gurdesthurr> 30 seconds
[19:33] <easy_d> Puyoing
[19:33] <siguchan> what is puyoing
[19:33] <zlyle90> puyo forever
[19:33] <adammatthews93> If I were to watch DBZ again, it'd be Kai, the filler was the worst part of DBZ for me, apart from when Goku and Piccolo drove
[19:33] <easy_d> Because it's Ringo
[19:33] <titatitanium> only shooting stars
[19:33] <gurdesthurr> not 50
[19:33] <kwimbob> Ringo (apple (in Japanese))
[19:33] <th3sharkk> whoa movement is all smoothe
[19:34] <titatitanium> WHAT THE HELL

[19:34] <samiam1616> A Tetripuyo
[19:34] <titatitanium> oh GOD
[19:34] <tunanoot> its a spear
[19:34] <kwimbob> you can swap the color of the big big ones
[19:34] <titatitanium> OH GOD WHY
[19:34] <easy_d> I think those pieces don't separate
[19:34] <gurdesthurr> ah yes, that episode is the best
[19:34] <samiam1616> They throw in some pieces from the Fusion mode in here
[19:34] <doormatt232> I tried to watch Dragon Ball Z like a year ago, got to the cell saga and then I stopped NotLikeThis the pacing finally got to me
[19:34] <zlyle90> Poopyo

[19:34] <rasetsu_0> lewd Kappa
[19:34] <titatitanium> jiggle physics
[19:34] <dawnyan> SALTY
[19:34] <gurdesthurr> jiggle what?
[19:34] <easy_d> I thought we were getting a combo
[19:35] <tunanoot> 7,8/10 too much jiggle
[19:35] <dawnyan> thats what I keep hearing now
[19:35] <jeboboid> it's cos you gotta chain them
[19:35] <jt_monochrome> hey lemon limes
[19:35] <kwimbob> @Easy_D They do separate, everything falls and lets you drop half away (to NOT match and later combo)
[19:35] <titatitanium> @Doormatt232 i only know the story because i played Video Games Kappa
[19:35] <pepperyena> Puyo is all about combos!
[19:35] <easy_d> oh ok
[19:35] <samiam1616> I think you can also change the actual appearance of the puyos in a settings menu or something
[19:35] <titatitanium> OTL
[19:35] <easy_d> I thought there'd be mean pieces that don't split
[19:35] <metasighty> do your best, limes!!
[19:35] <rasetsu_0> then stop being bad Kappa
[19:35] <siguchan> why didnt they just make tetris tetris tetris
[19:35] <skinny_mario> @samiam1616 Yeah, and Tetrominos, but you need to buy them.
[19:35] <ebrawl> wut, how do you make those points in such time?
[19:35] <ebrawl> nani?!
[19:35] <unamijo> @samiam1616 you can "buy" new apparence for the puyos and the tetris with the points you get from the campaing
[19:35] <tekthenerd> Theres a really easy way of setup puyos that anyone can do tbh
[19:35] <titatitanium> puyos make me think of Gerudo for some reason
[19:36] <pepperyena> PogChamp that was a good combo!
[19:36] <mario1080p> Already a better start
[19:36] <cpt_barricade> all according to keikaku
[19:36] <dawnyan> wait what day is it today limesHmm
[19:36] <doormatt232> Weds, Dawn
[19:36] <kwimbob> @Easy_D Puyo is all about gravity towards the bottom (you get punished from the top). The rare piece is a 4by4 that you can choose the color of (since you can't rotate a square)
[19:36] <samiam1616> The switch version has a cheat code you can use to unlock a bunch of stuff I think
[19:36] <tunanoot> (keikaku means apple)
[19:36] <mario1080p> Keep in mind you gain extra points by dragging them down
[19:36] <dawnyan> oh limesPup
[19:36] <titatitanium> dont cry lim
[19:36] <chainsawjoe32> 2nd still aint that bad
[19:36] <cpt_barricade> it's thursday now dawn
[19:36] <metasighty> @Ebrawl chaining multiplies points, so the the trick is chaining
[19:36] <th3sharkk> maximum overcombos
[19:36] <doormatt232> limesPup also I am in NA so best not to listen to me Dawn
[19:36] <dawnyan> oh limesPup
[19:37] <titatitanium> limesPup
[19:37] <barrelsofun> when you clear a challenge you can end it early by topping out if you don't give a damn.

[19:39] <tunanoot> pishy squyos
[19:39] <easy_d> Puyos, 4.. Quads..

[19:39] <easy_d> Krogan Balls are Puyos PogChamp
[19:39] <kwimbob> But she *is not* playing with Squishy puyos, but instead playing Tetris??? 🤔
[19:40] <bleachex> This game makes Daddy Vinny uncomfortable
[19:40] <rasetsu_0> sometimes, you just have to calm someone down with squishy balls Kappa
[19:40] <th3sharkk> move the controller to shake the puyos around

[19:40] <tekthenerd> She screams make-up stuff
[19:40] <skinny_mario> Hey, Rift.
[19:40] <th3sharkk> if tee says spin attack i'm calling fraud
[19:40] <titatitanium> @TunaNoot play BOTW to find out
[19:40] <dawnyan> imagine if your catchphrase was some random part of the body, like, "KNEECAPS"
[19:40] <easy_d> Why not
[19:40] <tunanoot> "FEET"
[19:40] <tekthenerd> She's the "im the pretty" character
[19:41] <siguchan> are puyos like those little squishy bead things

[19:41] <dawnyan> thats what I heard
[19:41] <theluigiguy> TehePelo
[19:42] <tekthenerd> The reason the game throws puyos at you a lot is because it increases in difficulty a lot later on
[19:42] <pepperyena> I'm pretty ill right now, so it's nice to just relax with a Limes stream!
[19:42] <ajajajaj5> eye socket
[19:42] <siguchan> tetris is beter than puyos

[19:43] <dawnyan> mimimimimimi
[19:43] <thebronygamesosu> Hey, lime girl, you taking challengers?
[19:43] <titatitanium> limesSalt
[19:44] <th3sharkk> she's playing single player at the moment
[19:44] <tekthenerd> Who's your favorite PPT character so Limes?
[19:44] <rasetsu_0> tbf, everyone on the Tetris side is space
[19:44] <titatitanium> something tells me limes does not like this character very much Kappa
[19:44] <pepperyena> @TitaTitanium She's part of a spaceship crew, so...
[19:44] <kwimbob> @TitaTitanium all of the Tetris' sub-theme is space
[19:44] <titatitanium> i mean yeah but
[19:44] <titatitanium> her more than the others
[19:44] <pepperyena> @TitaTitanium I think her role on the ship is 'whiny bitch'
[19:44] <unamijo> don't do it, they are ruttless
[19:44] <dawnyan> banned limesPup
[19:44] <signalerror> hahaha
[19:44] <titatitanium> uh
[19:44] <th3sharkk> *tetris*~~
[19:44] <thebronygamesosu> Awww, please? One round? I'll go easy on you!
[19:44] <mario1080p> sad but true
[19:44] <titatitanium> can't broadcast what?
[19:44] <unamijo> specially the puyo players are merciless
[19:44] <dawnyan> "I'll go easy on you" famous last words limesPup
[19:45] <titatitanium> what did limes just say i missed it
[19:45] <thebronygamesosu> I'm a Tetris player, so....
[19:45] <osomister> limes. you are rough on yourself
[19:45] <tekthenerd> Tetris is fun and fair to play against :^)
[19:45] <yue451> @Limealicious You can use the garbage to set up combos
[19:45] <kwimbob> garbage puyo are garbage to deal with
[19:45] <samiam1616> Tetris doesn't necessarily have much attack power from what I've seen but it's more forgiving with garbage
[19:45] <samiam1616> Whereas it's sort of the opposite for Puyos
[19:45] <siguchan> tetris is more fun
[19:45] <dawnyan> TitaTitanium someone challenged her to a multiplayer game, and she said no because she'd get beaten so badly that that kind of thing wouldn't be allowed on twitch
[19:45] <titatitanium> oh lol
[19:45] <dawnyan> thats how bad she'd be beaten limesPup
[19:46] <titatitanium> ahhh thank you
[19:46] <kwimbob> Tetris is the Mechanical game focused on yourself; Puyo is all about planning the combos, and Stacking High with Risk v Reward
[19:46] <foxesque> it's "endearing"
[19:46] <kwimbob> and watching out for their attack-timing from the top WutFace
[19:46] <dawnyan> Speaking of Spaceship girls, does anyone remember the cartoon show Atomic Betty?
[19:46] <titatitanium> i'm willing to bet a few scheckles that this is not limes' favorite character Kappa
[19:46] <dawnyan> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Betty
[19:46] <titatitanium> that green boy gives me headaches
[19:46] <th3sharkk> puyo puyo tetris solitare when
[19:46] <tunanoot> i'll bet a thousand bits
[19:47] <samiam1616> You can't just tell anime to go to hell
[19:47] <tekthenerd> thats how they get stronger
[19:47] <cpt_barricade> She reminds me of somebody limeshmm
[19:47] <cpt_barricade> limesTehe
[19:47] <th3sharkk> the music is nice
[19:47] <samiam1616> Seems like single puyo chains don't really rack up much damage
[19:47] <tacoman1320x> On the bright side, this is the most story a Tetris game has had since Tetris Worlds.
[19:47] <barrelsofun> You get a bonus for clearing the whole screen So when you get two sets of the same color, pop them for an all clear start
[19:47] <osomister> @titatitanium he is green? i thought he was blue

[19:48] <dawnyan> you like that? limesTehe
[19:48] <tehtomstergamer10> She's learning PogChamp
[19:48] <rasetsu_0> things happen and you play puyo and tetris

[19:48] <mrrussellthestone> I knew seal was good at video games limsFirst
[19:48] <thetragicomical> @Rasetsu_0 thanks brah
[19:48] <kwimbob> @samiam1616 Even using a 2colored block to clear 2 things the same time counts as a 1-combo with like 2 blocks of damage: Puyo IS ONLY about combos (unless clearing garbage if losing, then a single clear could save your life)
[19:48] <mrrussellthestone> limesFirst
[19:48] <th3sharkk> there's a bunch of annoying characters that solve problems by playing puyo puyo and tetris
[19:48] <emoparadox> The chains tho
[19:48] <dawnyan> Puyo requires thinking NotLikeThis
[19:49] <dawnyan> thinking is hard limesThump
[19:49] <rasetsu_0> that is basically the summary so far
[19:49] <thetragicomical> That's a pretty good impression
[19:49] <foxesque> aisha you should va for this game
[19:49] <ajajajaj5> i never think
[19:49] <mahbonk> no boolly
[19:49] <unamijo> Puyo is all about planing your moves
[19:49] <dawnyan> SMOrc thinking SMOrc
[19:49] <thetragicomical> Oh shit she's actually playing through the story? I was just making a funny at Vinny's expense. vineKappa
[19:49] <kwimbob> That's accurate NotLikeThis
[19:49] <metasighty> @TheTragicomical lore is basically tetris characters crash onto puyo universe and so far theyre trying to get everyone reunited so they can all go back to tetris universe
[19:49] <titatitanium> i feel very attacked right now
[19:49] <zlyle90> @Limealicious You should start saying FERRETS whenever you land a combo
[19:49] <unamijo> that's why garbage blocks are so harmful
